# -Text-preprocessing-and-plagiarism-detection-in-PDF-files
Designed and implemented a Python program that preprocesses and compares texts extracted from PDF files to detect potential plagiarism. Utilized natural language processing techniques and scikit-learn library to perform text vectorization and cosine similarity calculation.

Code: Using Python, Natural Language Toolkit (nltk), scikit-learn, PyPDF2.

Responsibilities: Developed the preprocess function that performs tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization. Implemented the PDF file reading and processing using PyPDF2. Utilized TfidfVectorizer and cosine_similarity functions from scikit-learn to perform text vectorization and calculate cosine similarity. Write report.

Results: Successfully detected potential plagiarism in a collection of PDF files using cosine similarity. Improved my understanding of natural language processing and machine learning techniques.
